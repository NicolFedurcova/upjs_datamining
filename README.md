## Abstract

This study explores the application of hierarchical clustering techniques to global energy consumption data, aiming to uncover patterns in electricity usage relative to socioeconomic indicators
such as GDP and population size. Using data from 28 countries, we analyzed energy consumption
across various renewable and non-renewable sources. Through a series of clustering experiments,
we identified the weighted-cityblock configuration as the most effective clustering approach for
our chosen data representatives, based on cophenetic coefficient values. Hierarchical Clustering
achieved a marginally higher Silhouette Score (0.44) compared to K-means (0.41), highlighting
its effectiveness in capturing nuanced patterns within the dataset. Key parameters, including
oil consumption, wind consumption, and GDP, were instrumental in revealing distinct clusters,
underscoring the relationship between economic development and energy consumption trends.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing these assignment, I have gained experience with:  

**Data preprocessing:** filtering features, handling missing values, standardizing data.

**Exploratory analysis:** dendrograms, heatmaps, and pair plots to understand structure.

**Hierarchical clustering:** experimenting with multiple linkage methods and distance metrics, tuning thresholds and criteria.

**K-means clustering:** applying and comparing results to hierarchical clustering.

**Cluster evaluation:** using cophenetic coefficients, inconsistency coefficients, and Silhouette Score.

**Interpretation:** identifying meaningful country clusters based on energy consumption and socioeconomic indicators.
